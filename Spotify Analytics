--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I formulated some questions I had about the data, and performed analytics on the data using SQL. 


CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL)
;


--First, I wanted to look at the data.

SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

--I immediately noticed the keys were numerically coded rather than a letter key, so I did some quick research to translate those into the letter version. 
--I created a new column in the table to insert the letter verions into in case the numerical coding becomes necessary in the future.

ALTER TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ADD letter_key varchar(255);
;

--I then inserted all the letter keys into the new column.

UPDATE BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    SET letter_key = CASE 
        WHEN song_key = 0 THEN "C"
        WHEN song_key = 1 THEN "C♯/D♭"
        WHEN song_key = 2 THEN "D"
        WHEN song_key = 3 THEN "D♯/E♭"
        WHEN song_key = 4 THEN "E"
        WHEN song_key = 5 THEN "F"
        WHEN song_key = 6 THEN "F♯/G♭"
        WHEN song_key = 7 THEN "G"
        WHEN song_key = 8 THEN "G♯/A♭"
        WHEN song_key = 9 THEN "A"
        WHEN song_key = 10 THEN "A♯/B♭"
        WHEN song_key = 11 THEN "B"
        ELSE null
    END
;

--I then looked into the statistics I was curious about. I put these in question and answer format for simplicity.


--How many songs are there in each key?

SELECT letter_key, COUNT(letter_key) AS song_amount
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY letter_key
ORDER BY song_key ASC
;


--Which artists have more than one song?

SELECT artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY artist_name
HAVING count(track_id)>1
;


--Which artist has the most songs (include all who tie for first place)?

SELECT
    artist_name,
    COUNT(track_id) AS songs
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY artist_name
HAVING songs>1
ORDER BY songs DESC
LIMIT 2
;

--Note: I first looked at the results of querey without limiting it to see who had the most songs. I then limited it when I saw that two artists tied for the top spot.


--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT 
    artist_name, avg(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10
;


--What is the longest song?

SELECT 
    artist_name,
    track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY track_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1
;


--What is the shortest song?

SELECT 
    artist_name,
    track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY track_name
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC
LIMIT 1
;


--What is the most popular song?

SELECT 
    artist_name,
    track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 1
;


--What is the least popular song?

SELECT 
    artist_name,
    track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity ASC
LIMIT 1
;


--What is the most dancable song?

SELECT 
    artist_name,
    track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
Group BY track_name
ORDER BY danceability DESC
LIMIT 1
;


--This could go on for a while until I see every single statistic, but I decided to stop here for this project.
