For this project, I used astronaut yearbook data from Kaggle that was compiled into a table by pamelafox on GitHub. Source: https://gist.github.com/pamelafox/b98e03caca7d1ec14394a90ec1512cff
I perfromed analytics on the data using SQL.



-- what is the average number of space flights an astronaut has in their career?
SELECT
    AVG(Space_Flights) AS Average_Space_Flights
FROM astronauts
;


-- what is the average length (in hours) of a space flights?
SELECT
    AVG(Space_Flight_hr) AS Average_Space_Flight_Length_in_Hrs
FROM astronauts
;


-- how many astronauts have been women?
SELECT
    Gender,
    COUNT(Gender) AS Astronaut_Count
from astronauts
WHERE Gender LIKE 'Female'
GROUP BY GENDER
;


-- how many astronauts have died on missions?
SELECT
    COUNT(Death_Mission) AS Astronaut_Deaths
from astronauts
;


-- what are the top 3 most common military ranks for astronauts and how many astronauts have had those rankings?
SELECT
    Military_Rank,
    COUNT(Military_Rank) AS Astronaut_Count
FROM astronauts
WHERE Military_Rank IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Military_Rank
ORDER BY Astronaut_Count DESC
LIMIT 3
;


-- how many astronauts are from each military branch?
